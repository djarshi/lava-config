    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Alot of people have spent effort into making tweaks for beyond all reason.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hi, i'm Djarshi a player in the game Beyond all reason.<br/>

        I started joining this Lava lobbies around 2023. I liked the scaling aspect of BAR and in LAVA this was utilized more. In 2024 here and there i saw 'tweaks'.
        So started to ask around. This led me to combine OPMans tweak of disabling sea with removing the pesky pawnlauncher.. and then ragnarok, calamity, starfall.<br>
        Removing the pawn launcher allowed to have extra t3 air units enabled since this implicitly also brought the dreaded pawnlauncher.
        <br/>
        Later BAR got expanded with disabling options.
        During that time Engiman was active and txpera also was looking for 'a better afus'. Which led to the creation of the Engi AFUS. these things were all added by using tweakunits.
        <br/>
        After some more time some shifted to using tweakdefs which allowed a little more more lua-programming in it. By then someone on the BAR dev team added the scavenger units (Big afus)..
        <br/>
        A very cool addition but it rendered the engiman afus a bit obsolete..
        <br/>
        Why stop there?  Lava tides, epic mex, epic geo, legendary engi afus, Zop Sky Ops, remove that 'f**' epic com.. <br>
        <br>
        Eco wise there were at least 3 versions of 'enhancing' the economy being used: ZopMaxima's eco pack, Djarshi lavapack, Engi eco and there were more I encountered but not all remember.

        ZopMaxima went on making this in a more unit based approach and in the end there was a QoL pack..<br>
        In between i discovered NuttyB also a very nice play mode :-). I recommend having a search for 'nuttyb' lobbies.<br>
        Options options and more options..<br>
        All these things make this a bit complex... let's see if we can make this a bit easier<br>
        <br>
        And THUS.... this configurator is born.
    </p>
