@tweakunits ${PARATROOPERS} 
```

## Paratroopers
No fall damage for dying transports.

```effect
!bSet unit_restrictions_noair 0
@tweakunits ${SKYOPS} 
```

## Normal air - burning CPU
If your CPU can take endgame ¯\(ツ)/¯
```effect
!bSet unit_restrictions_noair 0
```

In case you like long games.
Turning on special unit 'EngiBoss' and or riot titan is recommended in this case.
