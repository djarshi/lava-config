# Air
Changes to air units

## Sky Operations
More expensive stuff. Air units drop their trasnsports as paratroopers as well as AA is improved.

```effect
!bSet unit_restrictions_noair 0
@tweakdefs ${SKYOPS}
@tweakdefs ${UNLIMITED_SCREAMERS}
```

## Paratroopers
No fall damage for dying transports. AA is improved though.

```effect
!bSet unit_restrictions_noair 0
@tweakdefs ${PARATROOPERS} 
@tweakdefs ${UNLIMITED_SCREAMERS}
```

## Normal air - burning CPU
If your CPU can take endgame ¯\\(ツ)/¯
```effect
!bSet unit_restrictions_noair 0
```


## Air Off
In case you like long games.
Turning on special unit 'EngiBoss' and or riot titan is highly recommended in this case.
```
!bSet unit_restrictions_noair 1
```
